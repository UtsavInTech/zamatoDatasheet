# zamatoData Analysis
Hey there! ðŸ‘‹
This notebook is all about exploring restaurant data using real-world Zomato data (along with a little help from a country code sheet). The main idea was to dig into restaurant trends, especially focusing on India, and answer some interesting questions using Python.Whether you're working on a project, studying data science, or just curious about what restaurant data looks like â€” this should be a good starting point.

# What Youâ€™ll Find in This Notebook
	â€¢	I tried to achieve in this analysis:
 	â€¢	Merge the Zomato data with the country code sheet to identify countries properly.
	â€¢	Find the top-rated restaurants in every Indian city (based on ratings and votes).
	â€¢	Understand the relationship between ratings and the number of votes.
	â€¢	Count how many restaurants exist in each country.
	â€¢	Find the top 5 restaurants (with online delivery) in cities like Delhi and Chennai.
	â€¢	Identify budget-friendly restaurants that are still highly rated.
	â€¢	See which cuisines are popular in different regions.
	â€¢	Get the average restaurant rating for every city and country using a pivot table.
	â€¢	Check if cost is influenced by rating using a boxplot.
	â€¢	See which cities have the most restaurants (using a pie chart).
	â€¢	Zoom in on Indian cuisine and what people love (another pie chart!).
	â€¢	Extra tasks from class (like filtering restaurants in Gurgaon with online delivery).

# Tools I Used-
	â€¢	Python (mainly pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn)
	â€¢	Jupyter Notebook
	â€¢	Excel and CSV files (Zomato and Country codes)
	â€¢	Some curiosity and trial-and-error

# Why I Did This-
This was mostly a class project. But I ended up enjoying it more than I thought. It helped me understand how to clean data, merge datasets, create visualizations, and tell stories with numbers. If youâ€™re new to data science, youâ€™ll probably find this notebook useful to see how you can turn raw data into something interesting. Everythingâ€™s commented and easy to follow.

# Whatâ€™s in the Folder?
	â€¢	zomato.csv â€“ Restaurant data sourced from Zomato.
	â€¢	Country-Code.xlsx â€“ A file that maps country codes to their actual country names.
	â€¢	Untitled.ipynb â€“ The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code, analysis, and visualizations.
	â€¢	README.md â€“ This file. It explains what the project is about and how everything fits together.
