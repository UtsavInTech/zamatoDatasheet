# zamatoData Analysis
Hey there! 👋
This notebook is all about exploring restaurant data using real-world Zomato data (along with a little help from a country code sheet). The main idea was to dig into restaurant trends, especially focusing on India, and answer some interesting questions using Python.Whether you're working on a project, studying data science, or just curious about what restaurant data looks like — this should be a good starting point.

What You’ll Find in This Notebook
Here’s a breakdown of the goals (a.k.a. “objectives”) I tried to achieve in this analysis:
1  Merge the Zomato data with the country code sheet to identify countries properly
2  Find the top-rated restaurants in every Indian city (based on ratings and votes)
3  Understand the relationship between ratings and the number of votes
4  Count how many restaurants exist in each country
5  Find the top 5 restaurants (with online delivery) in cities like Delhi and Chennai
6  Identify budget-friendly restaurants that are still highly rated
7  See which cuisines are popular in different regions
8  Get the average restaurant rating for every city and country using a pivot table
9  Check if cost is influenced by rating using a boxplot
10 See which cities have the most restaurants (using a pie chart)
11 Zoom in on Indian cuisine and what people love (another pie chart!)
12 Extra tasks from class (like filtering restaurants in Gurgaon with online delivery)


Tools I Used-
Python 🐍 (mainly pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook
Excel & CSV files (Zomato + Country codes)
Some curiosity and trial-and-error!

Why I Did This-
This was mostly a class project, but I ended up enjoying it more than I thought. It helped me understand how to clean data, merge datasets, create visualizations, and tell stories with numbers.If you're new to data science, you'll probably find this notebook useful to see how you can turn raw data into something interesting. Everything’s commented and easy to follow.

 What’s in the Folder?
zomato.csv – Restaurant data from Zomato
Country-Code.xlsx – File that helps link country codes to actual country names
Untitled.ipynb – The main notebook with all the code, analysis, and charts
A README.md like this one to explain what’s going on
